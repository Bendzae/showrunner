> Formerly **claude-manager**.

A terminal UI (TUI) for managing multiple coding-agent sessions — Claude Code, Codex CLI and Pi today, more harnesses planned — organized by projects and tasks. Built with Rust using [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui).

Showrunner uses tmux to run agent sessions in the background, letting you organize them into projects and tasks, monitor their status, review diffs, and attach/detach freely.

## Prerequisites

- **Cargo** (Rust 1.85+) — [install via rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **tmux** — `brew install tmux` (macOS) or `apt install tmux` (Linux)
- **An agent CLI** on your PATH — **Claude Code** (`claude`, the default), **Codex CLI** (`codex`) and/or **Pi** (`pi`) — see [Agent harnesses](#agent-harnesses)
- **git** — for worktree and branch management
- **gh** (optional) — GitHub CLI, for PR creation features
- **hunk** (optional) — the default diff review tool (`r`), a terminal diff viewer ([modem-dev/hunk](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk)). Installed globally (`npm i -g hunkdiff`) it launches instantly; otherwise it runs via `npx hunkdiff` automatically (Node.js required), fetched on first use.
- **difit** (optional) — an alternative browser-based diff review tool, used when `review_tool = "difit"` is set in config. Installed globally (`npm i -g difit`) it launches instantly; otherwise it runs via `npx difit` automatically (Node.js required).

## Installation

Homebrew (macOS and Linux):

```bash
brew install Bendzae/tap/showrunner
```

Prebuilt binaries (macOS and Linux):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/Bendzae/showrunner/releases/latest/download/showrunner-installer.sh | sh
```

Or via cargo:

```bash
cargo install showrunner
```

Data lives in `~/.showrunner/`. Upgrading from claude-manager keeps all projects, tasks and sessions: on first start the old `~/.showrunner/` dir is migrated automatically (renamed, worktree git links repaired, live sessions re-pointed). Remove the old binary with `cargo uninstall claude-manager`.

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Bendzae/showrunner.git
cd showrunner
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```bash
showrunner
```

Launch from any directory. Configuration is stored in `~/.showrunner/config.toml`.

> **Tip:** When you attach to a session (with `Enter`), you're inside a tmux session. To detach and get back to showrunner, use your tmux detach binding — with the default prefix that's `Ctrl-b d`. The session keeps running in the background.

### Concepts

- **Project** — A git repository you want to manage agent sessions for. Added by its filesystem path (`p` prompts for path and name).
- **Task** — A unit of work within a project, tied to a git branch. Each task can have multiple sessions.
- **Session** — An agent instance (Claude Code, Codex CLI or Pi, per `default_agent`/`--agent`) running in a tmux session. Sessions can be created with an optional initial prompt, and (by default) in their own git worktree so they don't collide.
- **Main session** (`◆ main`) — Every task has one, created with the task. It works in a worktree with the **task branch itself** checked out, so its commits land on the task branch directly — no merge step. Extra sessions (`n`) get their own `<task-branch>-<name>` branch and merge back into it.
- **Adhoc session** — A project-scoped session that runs the agent directly in the project directory on whatever branch is checked out, with no task or worktree. Created with `A` from a project's context menu and grouped under the project. Handy for quick, throwaway work that doesn't warrant a task.

### Keybindings

All keybindings are customizable via `~/.showrunner/keybindings.toml`. The tables below show the defaults. See [`keybindings.example.toml`](keybindings.example.toml) for a full template.

#### Global

| Key | Action | Config key |
|-----|--------|------------|
| `j/k` or `Up/Down` | Navigate | `move_down` / `move_up` |
| `Enter` | Attach to session, or collapse/expand project or task | — |
| `Space` | Collapse/expand project or task | `toggle_collapse` |
| `a` | Open context menu | `context_menu` |
| `p` | Add project | `add_project` |
| `/` | Filter projects/tasks/sessions | `search` |
| `Z` | Toggle archived view | `toggle_archive_view` |
| `K` / `J` | Move the selected task or group up / down | `move_task_up` / `move_task_down` |
| `t` | Cycle color theme | `cycle_theme` |
| `q` | Quit | `quit` |

`t` cycles through the built-in themes: **default**, **catppuccin**, **tokyo-night**, and **dracula**.

#### Context Menu (press `a` to open)

The context menu shows actions relevant to the selected item. Press the hotkey character to execute directly, or navigate with `j/k` and confirm with `Enter`. Context menu keys are configured under the `[context_menu_keys]` section.

**Project actions:**

| Key | Action | Config key |
|-----|--------|------------|
| `t` | Add task | `add_task` |
| `T` | Add task, choosing the agent harness first | `add_task_with_agent` |
| `A` | New adhoc session | `new_adhoc_session` |
| `x` | Run the project's configured run command | `run` |
| `b` | Checkout branch (fuzzy-search the branch list) | `checkout` |
| `f` | Fetch & pull all branches (`git fetch --all --prune` + ff-only pull) | `fetch_pull` |
| `y` | Copy project path to clipboard | `copy_path` |
| `d` | Delete | `delete` |

The branch checkout picker opens a fuzzy finder over the project's local and remote branches — type to filter, `↑/↓` to navigate, `Enter` to check out (a remote-only branch is checked out as a new local tracking branch).

**Run command** (`x`, available on projects, tasks, and sessions) launches a per-project command in a dedicated tmux session and attaches to it. The first time you run it for a project you're prompted for the command (e.g. `npm run dev`); it's saved to that project's `run_command` config and reused everywhere afterwards. It runs in the selected item's working directory: the session's worktree for a session, the task's first session worktree (or the project dir) for a task, and the project dir for a project.

Each item shows a green run indicator while it has a live run session — an animated spinner (`⠙`) while the command is still executing, and a static `▷` once it finishes (the shell stays open so you can read its output). Detaching with `Ctrl-b d` leaves the command running in the background.

Pressing Run (`x`) again on an item that **already has a live run session** opens a small menu instead of relaunching:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `a` | **Attach** — re-attach to the running session |
| `r` | **Restart** — kill and relaunch the run command |
| `k` | **Kill** — stop the run session |

Run sessions are independent per item, so running on a different item starts a separate session. (Outside the TUI you can also list them with `tmux ls` and attach via `tmux attach -t cmrun-<name>`.)

**Task actions:**

| Key | Action | Config key |
|-----|--------|------------|
| `n` | New session (with worktree) | `new_session` |
| `S` | New session, choosing the agent harness first | `new_session_with_agent` |
| `N` | New session (without worktree) | `new_session_no_worktree` |
| `r` | Review branch-vs-base diff (difit or hunk) | `review` |
| `x` | Run the project's configured run command | `run` |
| `u` | Update/rebase branch onto its base branch (default `main`) | `update` |
| `B` | Set base branch | `set_base_branch` |
| `P` | Push branch | `push` |
| `b` | Checkout branch in project dir | `checkout` |
| `o` | Open/create PR | `open_pr` |
| `g` | Set group (fuzzy picker over existing groups; type a new name to create one) | `group` |
| `A` | Archive | `archive` |
| `d` | Delete | `delete` |

**Task group actions** (on a group header):

| Key | Action | Config key |
|-----|--------|------------|
| `t` | Add task to the group | `add_task` |
| `g` | Rename group | `group` |
| `G` | Ungroup tasks (dissolve the group) | `ungroup` |

**Session actions:**

| Key | Action | Config key |
|-----|--------|------------|
| `r` | Review uncommitted changes (difit or hunk) | `review` |
| `m` | Merge into task branch | `merge` |
| `u` | Update/rebase onto task branch | `update` |
| `t` | Open/attach a terminal in the worktree | `terminal` |
| `x` | Run the project's configured run command | `run` |
| `y` | Copy worktree path to clipboard | `copy_path` |
| `d` | Delete | `delete` |

The main session only offers Review, Terminal, Run and Copy path: it is already on the task branch, so Merge and Update have nothing to do, and it can't be deleted on its own — delete or archive the task instead.

The **Review** action (`r`) launches the configured diff review tool on the relevant diff — branch-vs-base for a task, uncommitted changes for a session. Choose the tool with `review_tool` in `~/.showrunner/config.toml` (`"hunk"`, the default, or `"difit"`):

- **hunk** (default, [modem-dev/hunk](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk)) opens a terminal viewer in the foreground, suspending the TUI until you exit. Comments you leave are polled from hunk's live review session while it runs and forwarded to the agent session on exit. (A comment added in the last fraction of a second before quitting may be missed, since hunk's session is gone once it closes.)
- **difit** opens a browser-based viewer in the background, so the TUI stays interactive. Any comments you leave are captured on exit and forwarded back to the agent session as a new prompt, so you can review a diff and hand the feedback straight to the agent. When a task review ends with comments and the task has several sessions, a picker asks which session receives them.

```toml
# ~/.showrunner/config.toml
review_tool = "difit"   # or "hunk" (default)
```

### Session Status Indicators

Sessions display their current status:
- **Running** — the agent is actively working
- **Waiting for input** — the agent is waiting for your response
- **Waiting for permission** — the agent stopped on a permission or question dialog
- **Finished** — the agent process has exited

### PR Status

Tasks with a pull request (found via `gh`) show it in the `PR` column as `#123` plus two glyphs, refreshed about once a minute. Selecting the task spells the same information out in the status bar.

| Cell | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `#123` / `#123 draft` / `#123 merged` / `#123 closed` | PR number and state (open PRs have no suffix) |
| `✓` / `✗` / `◌` / `·` | Review: approved / changes requested / review requested, no decision yet / no reviewers requested |
| `●` green / `●` red / `◍` yellow | CI: all checks passed / a check failed / checks still running (omitted when the PR has no checks) |

Merged and closed PRs show only their state, since review and CI no longer apply.

### Worktrees

Every session gets a git worktree so it works on an isolated copy of the codebase. The task's **main session** checks out the task branch itself; additional sessions created with `n` get their own `<task-branch>-<name>` branch. Use `N` to skip worktree creation and work directly in the project directory.

Because the main session's worktree owns the task branch, `b` (checkout in the project dir) fails while it exists — check out the branch in a worktree instead, or delete the task. **Update branch** (`u`) and session **Merge** (`m`) run inside that worktree rather than checking the branch out in the project dir. Worktrees are removed when their session is deleted, and all of a task's worktrees when the task (`d`) or project is deleted.

The project's `.claude/` directory is always copied into new worktrees, so project-level agent config and skills are available there. You can copy additional file patterns (e.g. `.env` files) by adding `copy_patterns` to your project config. To run commands inside each freshly-created worktree (installing dependencies, configuring git hooks, etc.), add `setup_commands` (a single string or a list):

```toml
[[projects]]
name = "My App"
path = "/path/to/my-app"
copy_patterns = [".env", ".env.local"]
setup_commands = ["npm install", "./scripts/configure-hooks.sh"]
```

### Configuration

The config file at `~/.showrunner/config.toml` is managed automatically through the TUI, but can also be edited manually:

```toml
# Global: agent harness new sessions run by default ("claude", "codex" or "pi");
# override per creation with --agent. Codex sessions launch in yolo mode with
# the work dir pre-trusted, and resume via `codex resume --last`. Pi sessions
# launch with `--approve` (project files pre-trusted) and resume via `pi --continue`.
default_agent = "claude"

# Global: skills/slash-commands run in every new session before the initial
# prompt (a single string or a list). Useful for priming context.
startup_skills = ["/prime"]

[[projects]]
name = "My App"
path = "/home/user/my-app"
copy_patterns = [".env"]               # files copied into each new worktree
setup_commands = ["npm install"]       # commands run in each new worktree
run_command = "npm run dev"            # command launched by the Run action (x)

[[projects.tasks]]
name = "fix-auth-bug"
branch = "fix/auth-bug"
base_branch = "develop"                # rebase/diff target (defaults to "main")

[[projects.tasks]]
name = "add-dark-mode"
branch = "feature/dark-mode"
group = "ui"                            # optional manual grouping in the task list
```

Most of these fields are set for you through the TUI (`run_command` on first Run, `base_branch` via `B`), so manual editing is rarely necessary. A running TUI picks up external edits on its next idle refresh.

#### Task groups and ordering

Tasks are listed in the order they appear in the config. `K` / `J` move the selected task up / down within its project (the change is saved to the config, so the CLI and web UI see the same order). Members of a [stack](#stacked-prs) move together as one unit.

Tasks can also be grouped by hand: `g` on a task opens a fuzzy picker over the project's existing groups (typing a name that matches none offers to create it; `(no group)` removes the task from its group), and every task in a project sharing that name is listed under a collapsible group header, its members marked with a `┆` rail. A grouped task moves within its group; selecting the header moves the whole group, and its context menu adds a task straight into the group, renames it or dissolves it. The group is stored as `group = "..."` on each `[[projects.tasks]]` entry and shows up as `group=...` in `showrunner list` (a `group` field in `--json`); from the CLI, `task create --group` and `task set-group` set it.

#### Stacked PRs

Tasks whose `base_branch` is another task's branch form a stack — the same relationship GitHub's stacked pull requests use (each PR's base is the previous branch in the chain). Showrunner detects these chains automatically and marks each member with its position, `⧉ 2/3`, in the TUI task list and in `showrunner list` (`stack=2/3`, or a `stack` object in `--json`). Stacked tasks are listed consecutively in chain order (root first), regardless of the order they were created in. To stack task B on task A, set B's base branch to A's branch with `B`. Creating a PR from a stacked task targets its base branch, so the PR lands stacked on GitHub.

#### Custom Keybindings

Create `~/.showrunner/keybindings.toml` to override any default keybinding. Only the keys you specify are overridden; everything else keeps its default. Example:

```toml
quit = "Q"
context_menu = "o"

[context_menu_keys]
delete = "x"
```

## Agent harnesses

Sessions can run any of the supported harnesses, chosen per creation (`--agent`, or the `T`/`S` picker keys) with `default_agent` as the fallback.

### <img src="https://github.com/anthropics.png" height="20" alt=""/> Claude Code

The default harness (`claude`).

- Launches with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; the session briefing is passed via `--append-system-prompt`.
- The showrunner skills are loaded as a Claude Code plugin (`--plugin-dir`), so they're available as `/commit-push-task` and `/manage-sessions` slash commands.
- Permission prompts and question dialogs surface as **Waiting for permission**.
- Dead sessions resume with `claude --continue`.

### <img src="https://github.com/openai.png" height="20" alt=""/> Codex CLI

`codex` — must be logged in via `codex login`.

- Launches in yolo mode (`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`). The work dir is pre-trusted via a `[projects]` entry in `~/.codex/config.toml`, since the first-launch trust dialog appears even in yolo mode.
- Codex has no system-prompt flag, so the session briefing is prepended to the first message.
- The showrunner skills are installed as plain SKILL.md folders under `.agents/skills/`.
- Dead sessions resume with `codex resume --last` (scoped to the work dir).

### <img src="https://pi.dev/logo.svg" height="20" alt=""/> Pi

`pi` — needs a provider and default model configured (`/login` inside pi, or `defaultProvider`/`defaultModel` in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`).

- No per-command approvals by design. Launches with `--approve`, which pre-trusts the project-local files showrunner injects (`.agents/skills/`) so the one-time project-trust dialog never blocks a session; the briefing is passed via `--append-system-prompt`.
- The showrunner skills are installed under `.agents/skills/`, which pi discovers natively.
- Dead sessions resume with `pi --continue` (scoped to the work dir).

### Feature support

All showrunner features work with every harness — what differs is the mechanism:

| | Claude Code | Codex CLI | Pi |
|---|---|---|---|
| Session briefing | `--append-system-prompt` | prepended to first message | `--append-system-prompt` |
| Showrunner skills | plugin (slash commands) | `.agents/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Auto-approval | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | yolo flag + pre-trusted work dir | yolo by design, `--approve` for project files |
| Attention dialogs | permission & question prompts | selectors (trust dialog etc.) | trust dialog & modal selectors |
| Resume | `claude --continue` | `codex resume --last` | `pi --continue` |
| Initial prompt, startup skills, status detection, `ask`/`send`/`output` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Mobile web UI (`serve`)

`showrunner serve` starts an HTTP server with a phone-friendly web UI for managing sessions remotely — view session statuses, read live output, send messages and keys (permission prompts included), review diffs, and create projects, tasks, sessions and adhoc sessions, delete tasks, or kill sessions.

```sh
showrunner serve                          # default 127.0.0.1:7878
showrunner serve --bind 0.0.0.0:7878     # bind another interface
```

The server has no authentication — keep it on localhost and expose it through your tailnet:

```sh
tailscale serve --bg 7878
```

This gives you a valid-HTTPS URL reachable only from your own devices. Open it on your phone and use "Add to Home Screen" to install it as an app.

## CLI

Besides the TUI and `serve`, the binary exposes the same task/session operations as commands. They act on the shared state in `~/.showrunner/`, so a running TUI picks the changes up on its next refresh. Agents running inside a session use these to manage each other (see [Agent skills](#agent-skills)), and they're handy from any shell.

```sh
showrunner list [--json] [--project <name>]      # projects, tasks, live sessions + status
showrunner task create <project> <name> [--branch <b>] [--base <b>] [--group <g>] [--prompt <text>] [--agent claude|codex|pi]
showrunner task set-base <project> <task> <branch>   # 'main' resets to the default
showrunner task set-group <project> <task> [<group>] # omit the group to ungroup
showrunner task delete <project> <task> --yes
showrunner session create <project> <task> [--prompt <text>] [--no-worktree] [--agent claude|codex|pi]
showrunner session kill <session> --yes
showrunner ask <session> <question> [--timeout <secs>]
showrunner send <session> <text> [--no-submit]
showrunner output <session> [--lines <n>]
```

Sessions are addressed by the refs `list` prints — `<project>/<task>/<session>` (e.g. `myapp/fix-auth/2`), `<project>/<task>` for that task's main session, or a raw tmux name. `list` marks the session you're calling from as `(this session)`, and reports the same statuses as the TUI (`running`, `waiting_input`, `waiting_permission`, `finished`); it samples each pane twice, so it takes a moment.

`task create` and `session create` mirror the TUI's flows exactly — branch, worktree, setup commands, startup skills and initial prompt included. `--base` sets the task's base branch so it joins a [stack](#stacked-prs); a newly created task branch then starts from that base instead of main. `task set-base` changes it later (the same thing the TUI's set-base-branch key does). `--group` puts the new task into a [task group](#task-groups-and-ordering), and `task set-group` moves an existing task into one (or out of its group, when the name is omitted). `task delete` and `session kill` are destructive (worktrees removed, branches deleted) and require `--yes`; a task's main session can only go away with its task.

**`ask`** sends a question to another session, waits until that agent finishes its turn, and prints its reply on stdout:

```sh
$ showrunner ask myapp/fix-auth/2 "which module owns token refresh?"
⏺ src/auth/refresh.ts — TokenRefresher. It's called from the interceptor in api/client.ts.
```

A busy session queues the question and answers when it gets there, so `ask` blocks for as long as that takes (default timeout 300s). On timeout, or when the target stops on a permission/question dialog, whatever it printed still goes to stdout and the exit status is non-zero. Use `send` to drop a message without waiting for a reply, and `output` to read a session's screen directly.

## Agent skills

The repo ships two skills (`showrunner-plugin/`) that let an agent running inside a session drive Showrunner without leaving the worktree:

- **`commit-push-task`** — commit changes on the current branch, fast-forward them into the task branch (in whichever worktree has it checked out), and push the task branch. In the main session, where the current branch *is* the task branch, it just commits and pushes.
- **`manage-sessions`** — view, create and manage other tasks and sessions, and ask an agent in another session a question, via the [CLI](#cli) above. Session agents are told about this in their system prompt, so they can fan work out to new sessions or consult a sibling agent that holds context they don't.

They're installed into every session's worktree automatically, in whatever form the agent discovers: a Claude Code plugin for Claude sessions (`/commit-push-task`, `/manage-sessions`), plain SKILL.md folders under `.agents/skills/` — the cross-agent skills location — for everyone else.

## Development

### Git hooks

The repo ships a pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) that runs `rustfmt`
on staged Rust files and re-stages them, so commits always match the
`cargo fmt --check` step in CI. Enable it once after cloning:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
